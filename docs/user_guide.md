## Introduction

The AI-Powered SDLC System is a comprehensive development environment that leverages multiple AI models to assist developers throughout the entire software development lifecycle. From initial code generation to documentation, testing, bug fixing, and optimization, this system provides intelligent assistance at every stage.

This user guide will help you understand how to use the system effectively and take advantage of its powerful features.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Internet connection for API access
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 1GB of free disk space

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

Alternatively, you can deploy the application to a web server for team access.

### API Key Configuration

To use the AI capabilities, you'll need to configure API keys for one or more of the supported AI models:

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the top-right corner of the application
2. Enter your API keys for any of the following services:
   - Model 1
   - Model 2
   - Model 3
   - Model 4
   - Model 5
3. Click **Save Settings**

Your API keys will be securely stored in your browser's local storage and will not be transmitted to any server except the respective AI service providers.

## User Interface

### Navigation

The application is divided into several sections, accessible from the sidebar:

- **Code Generation**: Create new code based on requirements
- **Documentation**: Generate documentation for existing code
- **Testing**: Create test cases for your code
- **Bug Fixing**: Identify and fix bugs in your code
- **Optimization**: Improve code performance and quality

Each section has its own dedicated interface with relevant controls and options.

### 3D Environment

The application features an immersive 3D background that can be toggled on or off:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Under **3D Environment**, toggle the **Enable 3D Background** switch
3. Adjust the **3D Quality** setting based on your hardware capabilities

### Dark Mode

The application supports both light and dark modes:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Toggle the **Dark Mode** switch to your preferred setting

## Features

### Code Generation

Generate code based on your requirements:

1. Navigate to the **Code Generation** section
2. Enter your requirements in the text area
3. Select the programming language and framework
4. Toggle options for including tests, documentation, and optimization
5. Click **Generate Code**
6. Review the generated code and explanation

#### Example Requirements

```
Create a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
```

### Documentation Generation

Generate comprehensive documentation for your existing code:

1. Navigate to the **Documentation** section
2. Paste your code in the input area
3. Select the programming language
4. Choose the documentation format (Markdown, JSDoc, etc.)
5. Click **Generate Documentation**
6. Review and use the generated documentation

### Test Case Creation

Create test cases for your code:

1. Navigate to the **Testing** section
2. Paste your code in the input area
3. Select the programming language
4. Choose the testing framework (Jest, Pytest, etc.)
5. Click **Generate Tests**
6. Review and implement the generated test cases

### Bug Fixing

Identify and fix bugs in your code:

1. Navigate to the **Bug Fixing** section
2. Paste your code in the input area
3. Enter any error messages or descriptions of the issue
4. Select the programming language
5. Click **Fix Bugs**
6. Review the fixed code and explanation of the changes

### Code Optimization

Improve the performance and quality of your code:

1. Navigate to the **Optimization** section
2. Paste your code in the input area
3. Select the programming language
4. Choose the optimization target (performance, readability, etc.)
5. Click **Optimize Code**
6. Review the optimized code and explanation of the improvements

## AI Model Selection

The system supports multiple AI models, each with its own strengths:

1. Click the AI model selector in the top navigation bar
2. Choose from the available models:
   - **DeepSeek**: Excellent for code generation and optimization
   - **Gemini**: Strong in documentation and explanations
   - **ChatGPT-5**: Well-rounded performance across all tasks
   - **Grok**: Specialized in bug fixing and code analysis
   - **Claude**: Particularly good at natural language understanding and documentation

You can switch between models at any time based on your specific needs.

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues

If you encounter issues connecting to AI services:

1. Verify your API keys are entered correctly in Settings
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure the API service is operational
4. Try using a different AI model

### Performance Issues

If the application is running slowly:

1. Reduce the 3D quality in Settings
2. Disable the 3D background entirely
3. Close other resource-intensive applications
4. Clear your browser cache

### Error Messages

Common error messages and their solutions:

- **"No API key provided"**: Enter your API key in Settings
- **"API rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes and try again, or switch to a different AI model
- **"Invalid input"**: Check your code or requirements for syntax errors

## Advanced Configuration

Advanced users can modify the `config.json` file to customize various aspects of the application:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "api_timeout": 30,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "models": {
    "deepseek": {"enabled": true, "priority": 1},
    "gemini": {"enabled": true, "priority": 2},
    "chatgpt": {"enabled": true, "priority": 3},
    "grok": {"enabled": true, "priority": 4},
    "claude": {"enabled": true, "priority": 5}
  }
}
```

You can also use the `deployment.py` script to create deployment packages for different environments.

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

To get the best results from the AI models:

- Be specific and detailed in your requirements
- Include context about your project and constraints
- Break complex tasks into smaller, focused requests
- Review and iterate on the generated output

### Security Considerations

- Never include sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) in your code when using the system
- Regularly review generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Keep your API keys secure and don't share them

### Workflow Integration

For optimal productivity:

1. Use code generation for initial prototyping and boilerplate code
2. Generate tests early in the development process
3. Use the bug fixing feature during debugging sessions
4. Apply optimization after core functionality is working
5. Generate documentation before sharing code with others
